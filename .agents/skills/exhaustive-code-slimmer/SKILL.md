description: Exhaustive code slimming, code-pruning, and approval-gated architecture cleanup workflow for maximizing removable code while preserving behavior and improving developer experience. Use when the user asks for code cleanup, ruthless simplification, dead-code removal, dependency pruning, refactoring for less code, DX architecture review, exhaustive shrinking, maximal code reduction, redundancy removal, or aggressive but behavior-preserving simplification.

# Exhaustive Code Slimmer

Goal: remove the maximum amount of maintained code that can be removed without changing externally observable behavior. Prefer deletion over abstraction, simple code over clever code, good DX over theoretical purity, and measured evidence over taste.

For audit-only or planning-only requests, stop at the requested findings or proposal. When implementation is already authorized, carry that scope through candidate review and verification without requiring the user to approve it again.

## Non-negotiables

- Establish a behavior-preservation oracle before changing code: build, typecheck, tests, lint if relevant, smoke commands, snapshots, API contracts, and migration checks.
- Apply the code-cleanliness guide in `references/code_cleanliness_guide.md`. Slim code must remain readable, explicit, locally understandable, and easy to change; do not create dense, clever, minified, or “golfed” code.
- Never count minification, obfuscation, whitespace-only deletion, or comment deletion as code slimming unless the user explicitly asks for artifact-size minification.
- Do not delete public API, migrations, generated files, feature-flag branches, compatibility shims, security checks, operational logging, or configuration without evidence that the oracle covers them or the user has declared them removable.
- Before an architecture-level change, check whether the user has already approved its option or scope. Continue approved work with a concrete migration and verification plan. For additional boundary moves, framework changes, module reshaping, or abstraction collapse, prepare feasible DX-improving alternatives and request only the missing scope decision; unrelated authorized cleanup may continue.
- Work from version control or a clean checkpoint. Keep every accepted deletion attributable to a candidate and oracle result.
- Continue until a fixed point: no untested candidate remains in the current search frontier and no accepted deletion enables new candidates.

## Workflow

1. **Baseline**
   - Record files, LOC, nonblank LOC, bytes, dependency count, top large files, duplicate blocks, and generated/vendor directories.
   - Run `scripts/code_slim_audit.py --repo . --json-output /tmp/slim-audit.json --markdown-output /tmp/slim-audit.md --candidates-output /tmp/slim-candidates.jsonl` when a repository is available.

2. **Architecture and DX gate**
   - Inspect whether the current architecture blocks effective slimming: circular dependencies, god modules, deep pass-through layers, scattered config, duplicated boundaries, framework-fighting patterns, unclear ownership, over-abstracted services/managers/adapters, or brittle build/test ergonomics.
   - Run `scripts/architecture_dx_scan.py --repo . --json-output /tmp/architecture-dx.json --markdown-output /tmp/architecture-dx.md` for heuristic signals when a repository is available.
   - If the architecture is reasonable, continue with deletion-first shrinking.
   - If architectural changes are needed, first reconcile them with the user's existing approval. For unresolved choices, prepare an architecture note with feasible alternatives, DX benefit, code-slimming payoff, migration shape, risk, oracle requirements, and expected net code reduction.
   - Keep unapproved architecture candidates as proposals. Continue independently authorized deletion or local-refactor work, and execute structural candidates only within approved scope.

3. **Oracle**
   - Build the strongest available oracle. If absent, create minimal smoke tests before deletion.
   - Read `references/oracle_design.md` for oracle composition and blind spots.

4. **Candidate enumeration**
   - Enumerate deletion and simplification candidates across every layer: files, directories, imports, exports, functions, classes, branches, duplicated blocks, dependencies, adapters, feature flags, config, tests, docs-only code paths.
   - Mark architecture-level transformations with `requires_user_approval: true` in candidate JSONL unless the user has already approved the scope.
   - Read `references/transformation_catalog.md` before proposing transformations.

5. **Exhaustive shrinking**
   - For small independent sets, perform exact subset search: test every subset and keep the highest deletion score that passes the oracle.
   - For large sets, partition by module/file/dependency class, run exact search inside each partition, then run global greedy/ddmin-style passes over survivors. Repeat inventory → exact/partitioned search → oracle until fixed point.
   - Use `scripts/exhaustive_shrink.py --repo . --candidates candidates.jsonl --oracle "<command>" --mode exact` for exact search, or `--mode partition-exact` when full powerset search is too large.
   - Approval-gated candidates are skipped by default. Use `--allow-approval-gated` only after filtering the candidate file to the explicitly approved scope; the flag does not authorize other candidates.

6. **Refactor only when it deletes net code**
   - Consolidate duplicate logic, inline unnecessary wrappers, collapse indirection, simplify control flow, and remove abstractions only when the diff reduces maintained code and improves clarity.
   - Treat behavior-preserving refactoring as small, verified steps.
   - For architecture refactors, first show the chosen design, affected boundaries, migration sequence, and rollback plan; then proceed only within the approved scope.

7. **Report**
   - Summarize before/after metrics, accepted candidates, rejected high-risk candidates, approval-gated candidates, oracle commands, residual blind spots, and next search frontier.
   - Include the shrink ratio: `(baseline nonblank LOC - final nonblank LOC) / baseline nonblank LOC`.
   - If an architecture option was proposed but not approved, report it as pending and keep the actual change set deletion-only or local-refactor-only.

## Search discipline

- First test high-yield removals: whole files, unused dependencies, obsolete feature flags, unreachable branches, unused exports, duplicate modules.
- Then test local reductions: function/class deletion, parameter deletion, branch folding, wrapper inlining, loop/control-flow simplification, duplicate-block consolidation.
- Finally test cross-cutting reductions: dependency graph cuts, package splits, schema/config pruning, and generated-artifact removal.
- Architecture-level moves are not “free cleanup.” They require a DX rationale, a net-code-reduction rationale, and explicit user approval before execution.
- After every accepted candidate, regenerate candidates because new dead code can appear.
- If exact search is infeasible, state the candidate count, partitioning strategy, budget, and why the result is maximal within that frontier rather than globally proven minimal.

## Architecture option format

When architecture is the blocker, present options in this shape:

```text
Option <N>: <architecture idea>
- DX improvement:
- Code-slimming payoff:
- What changes:
- What does not change:
- Oracle needed:
- Risk / rollback:
- Recommended when:
```

Use this choice handoff only while the architecture decision is unresolved. If the user has already selected an option or approved its scope, record that decision and proceed within it.
