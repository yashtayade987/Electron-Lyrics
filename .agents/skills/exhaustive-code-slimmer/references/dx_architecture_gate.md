# DX architecture gate

Use this reference when slimming is blocked by architecture rather than by isolated dead code. The purpose is to improve developer experience while still honoring the primary goal: less maintained code, behavior preserved.

## What counts as unreasonable architecture

Treat these as signals, not automatic conclusions:

- **Circular dependencies:** modules require each other directly or through short cycles, making deletion and testing hard.
- **God modules:** one file or package owns unrelated responsibilities and absorbs every change.
- **Pass-through layering:** controllers call services call managers call adapters with little or no branching, validation, IO, transaction control, or policy.
- **Ambiguous boundaries:** domain logic is mixed with UI, persistence, transport, auth, validation, and framework glue.
- **Scattered configuration:** one behavior is controlled by multiple config files, env names, feature flags, and default layers.
- **Duplicate abstractions:** multiple helpers, clients, mappers, DTOs, or repositories model the same concept differently.
- **Framework-fighting code:** custom routing, loading, validation, dependency injection, or build glue duplicates what the framework already provides.
- **Poor test ergonomics:** small behavior changes require integration-heavy setup because units cannot be constructed or observed directly.
- **Unclear ownership:** files are grouped by vague technical labels (`utils`, `common`, `services`, `managers`) rather than domain or feature responsibility.

## Approval requirement

Architecture-level candidates require approved scope. Existing user approval counts; a new audit or option note does not reset it. Examples of changes whose scope must be checked:

- Moving modules across directories or packages.
- Changing dependency direction.
- Collapsing service/adapter/repository layers.
- Replacing a custom architecture pattern with a framework-native one.
- Splitting a god module into feature/domain modules.
- Introducing, removing, or replacing a public boundary, package, route group, or module contract.
- Changing project layout, build graph, workspace structure, or test architecture.

When the necessary design or scope has not been approved, prepare concrete alternatives and ask for the unresolved decision before dependent implementation. Continue unrelated authorized cleanup. When the user already approved an option or scope, prepare its concrete execution and verification plan and proceed without another selection round.

## Option patterns

### Option A: Prune in place

- **DX improvement:** minimal disruption; faster path to remove dead code.
- **Code-slimming payoff:** low to medium; best for repositories with reasonable boundaries.
- **What changes:** unused files, imports, dependencies, branches, wrappers, and duplicate local helpers are deleted in current layout.
- **Risk:** lowest; does not solve structural coupling.
- **Recommended when:** architecture issues are mild or the user wants a conservative first pass.

### Option B: Flatten pass-through layers

- **DX improvement:** fewer files to inspect per behavior; simpler call chains.
- **Code-slimming payoff:** medium to high when services/managers/adapters are pure forwarding layers.
- **What changes:** inline or delete wrappers, point call sites to the real domain operation, remove obsolete interfaces.
- **Risk:** medium; public API and test mocks may depend on the old layers.
- **Recommended when:** trace shows repeated one-line wrappers or mechanical delegation.

### Option C: Feature/domain slice

- **DX improvement:** developers can change a feature in one local area; fewer cross-directory edits.
- **Code-slimming payoff:** medium; reveals duplicate mappers, config, validators, and test fixtures.
- **What changes:** move related UI/API/domain/data/test code into feature or domain modules with explicit boundaries.
- **Risk:** medium to high; import paths and build/test wiring change.
- **Recommended when:** logic for one behavior is scattered across many technical folders.

### Option D: Dependency-direction cleanup

- **DX improvement:** lower coupling, easier unit tests, easier deletion of adapters and optional features.
- **Code-slimming payoff:** medium; cycles often hide dead adapters and duplicated DTO conversion.
- **What changes:** introduce or restore one-way dependency rules; isolate framework/persistence/transport adapters from domain code.
- **Risk:** medium; requires careful migration and contract tests.
- **Recommended when:** circular dependencies, side-effect imports, or framework glue block safe deletion.

### Option E: Framework-native simplification

- **DX improvement:** less custom glue; easier onboarding for developers who know the framework.
- **Code-slimming payoff:** high when custom routing, validation, DI, state, or build machinery duplicates framework features.
- **What changes:** replace bespoke infrastructure with standard framework primitives already present in the project.
- **Risk:** medium to high; framework contracts must be covered by smoke tests.
- **Recommended when:** custom infrastructure exists mainly from historical drift, not product requirements.

## Execution after approval

For an option or scope already approved by the user:

1. Create a branch/checkpoint.
2. Strengthen the oracle around affected public behavior.
3. Convert the chosen architecture option into small candidates.
4. Record which user decision covers each candidate. Before using `--allow-approval-gated` with `scripts/exhaustive_shrink.py`, filter the candidate file to that approved scope.
5. Apply changes in the smallest behavior-preserving steps.
6. Re-run audit after each accepted group because architecture cleanup often exposes new dead code.
7. Report net code reduction and DX effects separately.

## How to keep architecture slimming honest

- Do not introduce a new architecture pattern unless it deletes code or unlocks a bounded deletion sequence.
- Do not replace one abstraction stack with another abstraction stack.
- Do not move files just to make the tree look tidy; moves must improve locality, dependency direction, or deletion potential.
- Do not claim DX improvement without concrete evidence: fewer touch points, fewer imports, fewer layers, faster tests, clearer ownership, less config, or fewer dependencies.
